# Time tracking dashboard (in progress)

This is a challenge proposed by Frontend Mentor, where we have to build a dashboard and put it as close to the suggested design as possible.

We can use whatever tools we want to simplify the challenge. The experiments are free.

We can practice working with JSON data, because a local data.json file is provided for the activities. This means that we can extract the data from there instead of using the contents of the _.html file_.
